Total hours so far: 4

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## Day 1: March 8th 2025
I reseached materials and what would be compatible with each other while staying in budget and my size constraints. I decided on an Extuder (Obbiter V2.0), and a Motherboard (BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 V3.0). 

I found a potential option for a printbed. It is quite difficult to find one that is in the correct size (100x100mm) as most come in 120x120 as the smallest size. I have decided that for the PEI Plate that I will buy a bigger size and cut it to the correct dimensions myself.

I then designed a quick and simple PCB for the small Optical Endstop Sensors that I can keep the printhead in build area.
