Total hours so far: 7

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## Day 1: March 8th 2025 
`Reseach` `PCB` `CAD`
- I reseached materials and what would be compatible with each other while staying in budget and my size constraints. I decided on an Extuder (Obbiter V2.0), and a Motherboard (BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 V3.0). 

- I found a potential option for a printbed. It is quite difficult to find one that is in the correct size (100x100mm) as most come in 120x120 for the smallest size. I have decided that for the PEI Plate, I will buy a bigger size and cut it to the correct dimensions myself.

- I then designed a quick and simple PCB for the small Optical Endstop Sensors that I can use to keep the printhead in build area for all axes.

- I also researched different methods of multicolour printing and what would take up less space. Started designing a PCB for a Rotary Switcher Multi Material System, but then realised it would be to big for my printer size. I settled on using an MMU but I think I will design that last so I get the core mechanics good first.

- Started a rough CAD model in Fusion of the frame to visualise the dimensions. I may change the 2020 Aluminium Extrusions to 1010.

## Day 2: March 9th 2025
`Research` `CAD`

- I reshaped the frame so that there was more space on the inside and it will be less confusing for physical connection when I build it. It is now 200mm<sup>3</sup>, using 8 x _2020 160mm Aluminium Extrusions_ and 4 x _2020 200mm Aluminium Extrusions_.

- I then researched power supplies - how they work, how to know what voltage, current, and wattage to use. I also researched different methods for the Z-Axis on a CoreXY printer. I figured out that due to the very small scale of my printer I won't need to support all 4 corners of the build plate.

- I also reasearched hotends and how to connect them to my extruder which is direct drive. I am going to design a 3D printable mount so I can connect my direct drive extruder (Orbiter V2.0) with my hotend (Short E3D V6 Hotend with PTFE).
