This is a small CoreXY 3D printer that I have designed from scratch including designing the Toolhead, Bed Assembly, Gantry and Belt System, as well as the Optical Endstops. See my journey of designing and building the printer [here](https://github.com/esemv07/OrbeXY-3D-Printer/blob/main/JOURNAL.md). This printer costs under $476.04AUD ($300USD). See my list of materials and prices [here](https://github.com/esemv07/OrbeXY-3D-Printer/blob/main/BOM.md).
